## Learning outcomes

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- describe Google Analytics
- read information from dashboards
- identify different sources of data
- navigate the directory structure in the project
- contribute to web docs online


## How to review another site

After Monday the 19th, look for `assigned review` document in Discord.
There you will find the websites that you need to review. Look at the sites and pretend
that you have eaten at that restaurant. In the `_explorations/review1.md` follow the
 and write your first review. In the `_explorations/review2.md` follow the
and write your second review.

## What to do after the reviews are written

Visit the website of your reviewers and find one quote from each review of
your restaurant. Add these quotes to your home page! Gatorgrade will look
for quote syntax in markdown.

Also look at your analytics data. In `_explorations/analytics.md` write about the
different sources of data contributing to the analytics automatic dashboards.
If you were a real restaurant owner, explain how this information could help
you improve your business and why you came to your conclusions.
