TODO: Look at your analytics data. Write about the
different sources of data contributing to the analytics automatic dashboards.
If you were a real restaurant owner, explain how this information could help
you improve your business and why you came to your conclusions.
The analytics tracked a variety of data. It tracked the website's number of visitors, what country they are visiting from (virtually), the days that they are visiting, event count, conversions, and the increases and decreases in those data categories. If I were a real restaurant owner this information could be insifghtful when making decisions for my business. First off, tracking the number of visitors wuold let me or a business owner know how much use the website gets, then allowing them to make better informed decsions about how much time and effort they want to put into the website. Tracking location would most likely be more helpful to more restaurant owners if it would track more precise locations, allowing them to have a better idea of where potential customers are.
