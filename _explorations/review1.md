> This restuarant checked nearly all of my boxes. To start, it was affordable, with all items on the menu only costing $7. The menu also had an expansive selection of fruity dishes to choose from. I had multiple of the menu items and they did not dissapoint. That is as long as you are a fan of fruit, as that was a large reoccuring theme throughout the menu items. Let get into the detail of the cuisine. The fruit was fresh and organic, and according to my waiter it is from a few locacl farms. I highly reccomend the Halo-Halo Supreme with Buko Lychee Cooler as the flavors meshed perfectly togethor. Anohter notable food item was Leche Flan with Strawberry, and I am not usually a fan of flan. The one negative I must knock the restuarant for is the uncomfy seating. I wanted to eat everything there, but didn't want to sit in one of their chairs long enough to do so. Overall I highly reccomend this restuarant for their food, maybe just get it to go.
