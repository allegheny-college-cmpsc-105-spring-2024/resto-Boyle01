This is an italian-mexican restaurante, inspired by iCarly. We specialize in a mix of two great food cultures that differ greatly. Bring the family to 22 Boo St., Gravitown, NM. We are open 2 hours every day: 5-7pm. You won't regret trying these unique delicious combos.

> Unc: "I had my skepticism about this place, but the flavor don't lie. 10/10."
